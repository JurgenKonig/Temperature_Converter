# Temperature_Converter

So, this wasn't planned out to be a 200+ line program that can do temperature conversions. Instead, it originally started out as "test.cpp", being used solely for trying out the basics of the C++ language and teaching it to myself. Soon after, however, I got the syntax and other nuances different from Java, which I have a couple years of experience with, and from there I wanted to flesh out a small program. 

As was the case with the Encryption program that I wrote in Java this past semester, I wanted to create something that had an interactable but simple interface from within the console. Since Java and C++ are so similar, this wasn't hard to do since I already had the infrastruture built. 

Outside of that, there's not much to say about it. It's super simple, and was mainly done as a way to just get me familiarized with the syntax as well as with the Visual Studio Code IDE. I certainly want to do more with C++ in the near future, hopefully making more advanced programs as I go along.
